# ðŸ§  Guide to Selecting the Perfect MCU

This is a step-by-step guide designed for Electronics and Electrical Engineers to help you choose the **right Microcontroller Unit (MCU)** for your project.

## ðŸ“„ What's Inside

A structured document covering:

- Application requirements
- I/O pin planning
- Core architectures (ARM, AVR, RISC-V, etc.)
- Memory needs (Flash, SRAM, etc.)
- Important peripherals (ADC, PWM, Timers, etc.)
- Communication protocols (UART, I2C, SPI, CAN)
- Power and performance considerations
- Ecosystem and IDE support
- Cost and availability
- Scalability for AI and future-proofing
